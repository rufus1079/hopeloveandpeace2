The program serves local communities, including St. Michael, by providing education and personal support.  St. Rita Ministry also provides referral assistance to Interact of Wake County in NC, local law enforcement agencies, Triangle Family services, the DOSE program (Developing Opportunities for a Safe Environment) and other supportive agencies.
